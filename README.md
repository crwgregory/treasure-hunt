# The Treasure Hunt
Can you figure out what the clue is and where it leads?

## Reason
I get a lot of recruiters asking me to look at available positions that they have. 
I made this to add a challenge and reward to anyone or any recruiter who can complete it.

## Directions
1) Decipher the `clue.txt` file. 
2) Send me a message with a screenshot of the secret poem!

> For we might not see the path right away, but when we come back, it's as clear as day!

Cheers!
